## Description
An application that puts together people from the same community in time of crisis. The initial focus of our users are those who can't leave their homes for one reason or another. There are people who want to help and they would also use this app to support those in need.

## User Story
AS An app user
I want to be able to ask for help during crisis time
SO THAT I can receive the support of my community when I am unable to go outside my house
As An app user
I want to find people in need 
So THAT I can choose who I want to help 

## How to Use this App
This app uses Facebook login. If you are in need of help, click on "need help" option. It will take you to a form where there will be a few options, including address information - common requests in times of crisis - and you can click in one of the options. (The information will be saved in MySql database). If you want to help someone, then click on "I can help" and  you will see "near me" the options of solicitations for help. Make your choice by clicking "select" button. After the selection, that task will show up in your help basket. You'll communicate through e-mail.

## Future improvements
In the future, there will be added 2 more buttons in the "help basket" with options of "approve" and "deny" help.
