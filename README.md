## Description
An application that puts together people from the same community in time of crisis. The initial focus of our users are those who can't leave their homes for one reason or another. There are people who want to help and they would also use this app to support those in need.

## User Story
AS An app user
I want to be able to ask for help during crisis time
SO THAT I can receive the support of my community when I am unable to go outside my house
As An app user
I want to find people in need 
So THAT I can choose who I want to help 

## How to Use this App
This app uses Facebook login. There are 2 types of users: the ones who need help and the ones who want to help. If an user needs help, he/she will click on "I need help" button. It will take her to a form where there will be a few options, including address information - common requests in times of crisis - and the user will click in one of the options. (The information will be saved in MySql database). The user searching to help someone, will click on "I can help" and he/she will see "near me" the options of solicitations for help. ---------------------------------------------
